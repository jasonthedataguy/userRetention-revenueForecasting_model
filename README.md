# User Retention and Revenue Forecasting Model
## Overview
The User Retention and Revenue Forecasting Model is designed to help businesses predict customer behavior and revenue streams based on historical data and key metrics. The model utilizes a curve-fitting method to forecast retention and revenue for marketing purposes.

## Limitations
It is important to note the limitations of the model:

The model relies on a curve-fitting method, which may not be highly accurate when applied to a specific cohort for a short period of prediction time. However, it performs well when multiple cohorts are considered and when there is a sufficient sample of users.
## Getting Started
To use the model, follow these steps:

Provide the following information for the prediction:
Device: Specify the device used by the users (e.g., desktop or mobile).
Channel: Specify the marketing channel used to acquire the cohort of users (e.g., LdPlayer).
Install_date: Specify the date on which the cohort of users was acquired (e.g., 2023-03-01).
inputDate: By default, set it as the latest date. This can be used to simulate and evaluate the model's performance (e.g., 2023-05-30).
outputDate: Specify the future date for which you want to generate predictions (e.g., 2023-10-30).
## Interacting with the Dashboard
Once you have provided the necessary information, the model will generate forecasts for future retention and revenue based on the specified input parameters and assumptions. The dashboard allows you to adjust these input parameters and simulate predictions using historical data. This enables you to evaluate the model's performance and refine the input parameters and assumptions to improve the accuracy of the forecasts.
